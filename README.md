I've created this game to learn! and practice vanilla javascript, css and htlm.
Therefore the code is sometimes needlessly complicated, messy and needs a lot of optimalization, but the game works.
As I keep learning I try to clean and optimize the code... and from time to time add some new features.


#### To play you need your own files

  - all image formats are accepted, however the functionality depends on the browser support
  - audio accepts mp3, wav and ogg
  - video accepts mp4, ogg and webm
  - file size is not limited but uploading big files is not recomended/tested (whole movies, etc. )


#### Rules

You are to find two identical files (images, audios, videos).
If you do, you score 1 point and continue the search.
If you don't, it's next player's turn.
The game end when all the pairs are found.
The winner is the player with the highest score.


#### How to play

Click/touch the card to show it's face.
Doubleclick/swipe (anywhere) to turn back the missed pair.
You don't have to wait for the whole audio or video file to finnish playing.
